# Layl v2

Re-write of https://github.com/mr-islam/layl to fix deep bugs, enjoy a new framework, etc.

## Status
Stable and released!

## License

GPL v3 for the codebase, but all rights reserved for the images and art. 

## Development

I work on this as a hobby during my freetime, so my full effort & focus goes to actual updates that benefit *users* and thorough bug-testing. Thus documentation and the issues board on GitHub are not updated regularly.
 
Please contact me if some code is unclear, or if you would like to contribute so I can share development plans. I would be more than happy to update the project plans or code documentation as soon as there are people interested in contributing—until then, I'm full-focus on actual improvements 👍. 

Scripts are in `package.json`, pretty clear I think.
